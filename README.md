Introduction
------------

This text-to-speech conversion application
serves to read a file using speech. This is
where the user, instead of reading it, wants
the machine to do so in order to listen to his/her
work, or for any other reason as well. In addition, it 
also provides usability and accessibility features
for those users that are unable to read effectively
on their own due to dyslexia or any other disorder.

The file to be read must be in the project folder.
